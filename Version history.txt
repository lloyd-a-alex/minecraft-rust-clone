Updated Version Table:  
Version    Milestone Name                      Key Changes / "Diabolical" Shifts
0.0.1      The Gray Void                       Initial Ursina Python script. Basic red crosshair, gray screen, broken shaders.
0.1.0      Procedural Awakening                Added procedural texture generation in memory (Grass, Dirt, Stone). Movement enabled.
0.2.0      The Hand Update                     Added the "Arm/Hand" entity, head bobbing, and dynamic FOV for sprinting.
0.2.1      The Unlit Patch                     Fixed "White Screen" by removing broken fog and switching to unlit materials.
0.3.0      Survival Alpha                      Added hotbar selection (1-5), tree generation, and inventory UI.
1.0.0      The Rust Migration                  DIABOLICAL REWRITE #1. Abandoned Python/Ursina. Moved to Rust + WGPU for massive performance.
1.0.1      Memory Leak Fix                     Resolved buffer overflows in write_texture. Fixed math overflow panics.
1.1.0      The Glam Update                     Switched math backend to glam. Implemented Mouse Look and Cursor Locking.
1.1.1      Collision Patch                     Fixed coordinate system mismatch in world.rs so player stops falling through the void.
1.2.0      Meshing Overhaul                    Transitioned from naive instancing to Chunk Mesh Generation to fix intense lag.
1.3.0      The Atmosphere Update               Added Day/Night cycles, Beta 1.7.3 Style Fog, and Ambient Occlusion.
1.3.1      Visual Fidelity Fix                 Resolved the "grass panes" bug by fixing global neighbor culling and UV winding order.
1.3.2      Full Block Rendering Fix            Fixed blocks not rendering all six faces across all biomes (snow, grass, sand). Corrected face culling logic, eliminated compiler warnings, ensured consistent 3D block rendering.

1.3.3      Vertical Collision Patch             Fixed critical variable shadowing bug in check_collision_vertical (renamed _y to y). Added delta time clamping to prevent clipping through blocks on frame spikes.
1.4.0      The Full Cube Update                 DIABOLICAL REBUILD #2. Overhauled face culling system in renderer.rs. Every block now renders all 6 faces when exposed to air/transparent blocks. Full cubes guaranteed—no more "panes". Proper neighbor checking across chunk boundaries.
1.4.1      Tree Density Fix                     Replaced uniform modulo-based tree placement with deterministic hash-based spawn logic. Forest biome trees now appear naturally (~2% chance) instead of grid-like. Uses wrapping multiplication to prevent overflow.
1.4.2      Compiler Cleanup                     Removed #[allow(dead_code)] warnings. Properly integrated is_opaque() into renderer culling pipeline. Marked unused get_selected() as #[allow(dead_code)] pending interaction system.
1.5.0      The Raycast Update                   Implemented Fast Voxel Traversal raycasting algorithm. Added world.raycast() for block interaction detection, returning hit + placement positions. Enabled proper block breaking/placing.
1.5.1      Block Interaction System             Integrated mouse input in main.rs. Left-click breaks blocks (sets to Air). Right-click places blocks from hotbar. Eye position at 1.62 units above center.
1.5.2      Mesh Rebuild on Modification         Hooked block break/place into renderer.rebuild_chunks(). World changes now instantly reflect in chunk meshes.
1.5.3      Mutability Refactor                  Made world mutable in main.rs and threaded &mut World through event loop to satisfy borrow checker while still allowing interactions.
1.5.4      Raycasting Mutability Fix            t_max_x / t_max_y / t_max_z made mutable in raycast loop so traversal increments compile and run correctly.
1.5.5      Player Interaction Cleanup           get_selected() now routed through player.hotbar.get_selected(). Block placement uses selected hotbar item, fully functional and tested.

1.6.0      Inventory Overhaul                   Expanded inventory to 36 slots (9 hotbar + 27 storage). Implemented stacking, item structs, and clean slot indexing.
1.6.1      Item Drops & Pickup                  Added ItemEntity with position/velocity/count. Dropped items fall, bounce slightly, and can be picked up within radius. Inventory.add_item aggregates stacks.
1.6.2      Health & Death System                Introduced 20 HP health bar (10 hearts), fall damage, death state, and respawn with R key. YOU DIED + RESPAWN UI.
1.6.3      Stack Count Rendering                Slot items render with count numbers using bitmap font. Only non-1 stacks show text overlay.
1.6.4      Water Physics Alpha                  Implemented basic water levels (Water1–Water8). Swimming slows movement, falls into water cancel fall damage if deep enough.
1.6.5      Crafting Grid UI (2x2)               Added 2x2 crafting grid + output slot. Crafting grid stored in Inventory, output calculated by recipe matcher.
1.6.6      Player Height & Feel                 Adjusted player height and eye offset so logs/blocks line up properly in view. Head bob tuned to feel more Minecraft-like.
1.6.7      World Seeds                          Worlds keyed off numeric seeds. Same seed → identical terrain. Start of reproducible worlds system.

1.7.0      Custom RNG System                    DIABOLICAL REWRITE #3. Replaced rand crate with SimpleRng (LCG) for deterministic worldgen without external dep. All randomness (trees, ores, noise permutation) seeded.
1.7.1      Floating-Point Bugfixes              Fixed vz undefined in renderer, cleaned Operations type mismatch and f32/u32 warnings. Stabilized math across world and renderer.
1.7.2      Entity Borrow Fix                    Resolved borrow checker conflicts in entity update and world iteration by using take/retain pattern on self.entities.
1.7.3      Entity Rendering & Shadows           3D spinning items with bobbing and simple blob shadows added. Items now visually stand out and feel Minecraft-y.
1.7.4      Inventory Click Mapping              Corrected NDC ↔ screen-space mapping for mouse clicks. Inventory and hotbar slots now clickable under cursor reliably.
1.7.5      Unused Import Cleanup                Removed VecDeque, HashSet, Mat4, and unused CHUNK_SIZE_* imports. Cleaned compiler warnings without removing functionality.

1.8.0      The World Gen Overhaul               DIABOLICAL REBUILD #4. Beta 1.7.3-style terrain. Large Perlin rivers (width ~0.15) carve through land, sand beaches (~0.22) around water, smooth mountains (height 50–100), and diverse biomes (plains, forest, desert, mountains, snow).
1.8.1      Font Texture Fix                     Moved font tiles from atlas indices 16+ to 200+ so they no longer overwrite ore textures. Fixed “random ores in UI text” bug. Tweaked water alpha to ~150 for translucency.
1.8.2      Tree Rarity Tuning                   Forest tree probability ≈2%, plains ≈0.2%, other biomes ≈0%. Tree heights 4–7 blocks, sparse foliage (10% leaf holes), and no trees in river tiles.
1.8.3      Player Height Adjustment v2          Eye height locked at 1.62 blocks. Head bob amplitude set to ~0.05. Player now looks logs dead-on, matching classic Minecraft feel.
1.8.4      Water Translucency & Levels          Water blocks use per-level height (Water8 full, down to Water1). Proper translucency and stacked water visuals.
1.8.5      Crafting Grid Reposition             Moved 2x2 crafting grid higher in inventory (around Y=0.5). Updated click bounds so slots and arrows line up visually.
1.8.6      Item Drop Physics v2                 Dropped items no longer jitter or bob violently. Horizontal velocity damped by friction, vertical snaps on ground. Items spawn at exact block center.
1.8.7      Block Breaking Overlay System        Replaced simple progress bar with 8-stage breaking overlay textures. Break speed depends on block hardness and tool speed.
1.8.8      Sun/Moon & Sky Cycle                 Implemented day-night cycle with moving sun and moon, smooth sky color transitions (blue → orange → night blue) driven by TimeUniform.
1.8.9      Terrain Gen Optimization             Reduced render distance, memoized noise lookups, chunk-based caching. Only changed chunks re-meshed.

1.9.0      Performance Crisis Resolution        DIABOLICAL FPS RECOVERY. Cached chunk meshes, batched entity updates, optimized water simulation, added frustum-ish culling. FPS back to ~120–180 at 720p.
1.9.1      Water Physics Optimization           Limited water flood-fill steps, processed only boundaries, and reused queues. Avoided runaway CPU usage in large fluid regions.
1.9.2      Block Hardness System                BlockType hardness added (dirt/grass/sand soft, stone/ores hard, bedrock unbreakable). Break time = hardness / tool_speed.
1.9.3      Tool Speed & Class System            Tool classes (pickaxe/axe/shovel/shears) and speed multipliers added (wood/stone/iron/gold/diamond). Wrong tool → slower breaking.
1.9.4      Ore Distribution Expansion           Ore BlockTypes with proper depth probabilities (Coal, Iron, Gold, Diamond). Ore drops and cobblestone behavior hooked up.
1.9.5      Compiler Warnings Cleanup            Fixed mut height warning, renamed hit_block → _hit_block. Marked unused variants with #[allow(dead_code)]. Clean build before next big step.

1.10.0     Multiplayer Foundation               Introduced network.rs with NetworkManager. Client-host TCP system using serde + bincode. Packets for Handshake, PlayerMove, BlockUpdate, Disconnect. One-host + one-client model.
1.10.1     Block Sync Broadcasting              Hooked block breaking/placing to BlockUpdate packets. Both peers see same block changes when network packets arrive.
1.10.2     Remote Player Struct & Rendering     Added RemotePlayer struct (id, position, rotation). Renderer draws other players as simple skin-textured boxes (body+head) rotated by their Y rotation.
1.10.3     Join Flow & Default IP               main.rs join flow improved: pressing Enter on IP prompt defaults to 127.0.0.1:7878. Eliminated crash when user provided empty IP string.
1.10.4     Connection Timeout Handling          NetworkManager.join now prints clear “CONNECTION TIMED OUT: Could not find server at 127.0.0.1:7878” panic message when server unreachable, instead of silent hang.
1.10.5     Dual-Instance Local Test Mode        Allowed host + client to run on same machine (log shows HOSTING SERVER ON 0.0.0.0:7878 and CONNECTING TO: 127.0.0.1:7878). Verified NEW PLAYER CONNECTED logging from TcpListener.

1.11.0     Git & History Tracker Integration    Set up full Git + GitHub CLI workflow: git init, commit, branch main, gh auth login, gh repo create, and remote origin configured. Repository `lloyd-a-alex/minecraft-rust-clone` created and first push done.
1.11.1     save.bat Macro                       Added root save.bat: runs git add ., git commit "AI Update: %date% %time%", git push -u origin main. Single save command snapshots full project state.
1.11.2     Branch Normalization                  Renamed local branch master → main and pushed main, then set origin/main tracking. Ensured save script pushes correct branch and fixed “src refspec main does not match any” errors.
1.11.3     Repo Default-Branch Cleanup           Used gh repo edit --default-branch main and git push origin --delete master to make main the only canonical branch. Prevented accidental pushes to master.
1.11.4     src/save.bat Relay                    Added src\save.bat that cd .. and calls root save.bat so you can type save from src as well. Makes saving agnostic to working directory.

1.12.0     UI & Inventory Polish                 Restored full UI stack from old project into current renderer: arm/hand swing, hotbar, hearts, inventory grid, crafting grid, and cursor item rendering, all in a dedicated ui_pipeline.
1.12.1     Crafting UI Reposition                Crafting 2×2 grid moved to around (0.3, 0.5) in NDC in inventory screen, with output slot and "CRAFTING" label plus "->" arrow. Cursor item follows mouse using proper NDC conversion.
1.12.2     Pause Menu & State                    Implemented is_paused flag and pause overlay: darkened screen, "PAUSED" title, "ESC RESUME" and "Q QUIT" hints. Pausing stops head bob and hides arm unless inventory open.
1.12.3     Health & HUD Finalization             Heart row above hotbar, heart textures at index 12, updates with player.health. Hotbar selection highlight added using texture 11, base slot texture 10. Arm swing tied to walk_time.
1.12.4     Water & Underwater Sky Color          Sky color shifts to deep blue when player’s head block is water (underwater feel). Invincibility timer flashes sky golden. TimeUniform used to drive sky and animations.
1.12.5     Lighting & Torch Influence            calculate_light samples nearby blocks for torches and boosts light up to 1.0 near them, with falloff by distance. Side faces apply lower AO factor (0.6–0.8).

1.13.0     Entity Rendering Unification          Merged spinning item entities and remote-player rendering through shared add_rotated_quad helper. Items use bobbing + rotation, players rendered as stacked quads with skin/heart textures.
1.13.1     Mesh & Face Logic Consolidation      should_draw_face handles air, torch, transparent neighbors and water-level mismatches to decide when to draw faces. add_face builds properly lit, textured faces for all six directions.
1.13.2     Resize Safety & Depth Rebuild         resize() reconfigures surface and recreates depth texture on window size change. Prevents crashes when resizing game window and keeps depth testing correct.
1.13.3     Logging & Build Banner                logger prints nice box banner, version, and logging level on startup for both host and client processes, making host/client instances obvious in logs.

1.14.0     Multiplayer UX Hardening              Improved host/join logs: HOSTING SERVER ON: 0.0.0.0:7878 and CONNECTING TO: 127.0.0.1:7878 with explicit CONNECTED! / NEW PLAYER CONNECTED messages. Clearer feedback when starting a 2-player session.
1.14.1     Network Timeout Visibility            Panic messages at src/network.rs:101 emit clear ❌ CONNECTION TIMED OUT errors when join cannot reach server. Encourages correct host-first, then join flow.
1.14.2     Git Workflow “Feels Good”             Confirmed end-to-end: save from root or src, pushes to GitHub, main-only branch model, remote URLs correct. Project now fully versioned; every AI session can be snapshotted safely.
